### An Chrome extension for the site [1K4A-Passwords](https://one-key-for-all-paswords.herokuapp.com/): generating and recovering passwords without saving the passwords in any database, allows the user to generate and recover all his passwords from one private key.

Over the years we have all signed up for many sites and a large percentage of them we have forgotten their password and now we want to connect to them, or maybe we kept the passwords on a database in a remote place that we have no idea who is responsible for our security, or maybe in a good condition we keep the passwords in a notebook. 

1K4A-Passwords will solves those problems for you! 

## Site Features

* Use of the private and public key concept to secure password recovery only by the private key owner.
* Generate passwords with unlimited length.
* Randomly generate passwords.
* Password can be modified easily.
* Option for using patterns to generate passwords.
